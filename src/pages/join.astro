          <h3>Donate $2,000 per full-time equivalent developer on staff</h3>
          to Open Source maintainers or
          <a href="https://fossfoundation.info/">foundations</a>
          of your choice, and commit to doing so in future years. The projects youâ€™re donating to should meet the
          <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition</a>.
          Of course, this includes any existing donations youâ€™ve made this year. You can donate to any projects you
          like, but if you need help figuring out which projects you depend on, you can use a tool like
          <a href="https://thanks.dev">Thanks.dev</a>.

          <h3>Publish a blog post</h3> or equivalent on your company website, detailing the contributions your company
          has made to the Open Source ecosystem the past year. This post does not need to be long or exhaustive. If in
          doubt, check out sample posts by
          <a
            href="https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-500-000-dollars-to-open-source-maintainers/"
            >Sentry</a
          >
          or
          <a href="https://astral.sh/blog/astral-oss-fund">Astral</a>.

          Ideally, this post would include an itemized list of how much was paid to each maintainer/foundation. When
          this is undesirable or unrealistic, we ask that you make a best effort. To more conveniently get an
          itemized list, consider using the
          <a href="https://github.com/opensourcepledge/osp-github-reporter">Open Source Pledge GitHub Reporter</a>,
          or
          <a href="https://thanks.dev">Thanks.dev</a>.

          <h3>Create a short JSON file with your company and donation info,</h3>
          and host it at any URL you wish. You can check out an
          <a

            >example JSON report</a

            >full schema</a
          >. You should update this JSON file at least once per calendar year â€” weâ€™ll fetch it regularly. All amounts
          are in USD so that different reports can be compared to each other. If youâ€™re using a different currency, you
          should convert all amounts to the USD equivalents, using the most appropriate exchange rate.

          Each <code>annualReport</code> should contain:

            </li>
            <li>
              <code>monetaryValueofTime</code>, <code>monetaryValueOfMaterials</code>: You may also optionally
              specify, in approximate US dollar equivalents, your contributions to the Open Source ecosystem in
              sponsored developer time (in <code>monetaryValueOfTime</code>) or gifts in kind (in
              <code>monetaryValueOfMaterials</code>). While we acknowledge that contributions in time and in kind
              are important, they are not included in the cash pledge amount. They will still be displayed on your
              member page.
